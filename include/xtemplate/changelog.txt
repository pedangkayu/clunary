 * 	comment} to get different output for each (thanks again for the
 * 	feedback Oliver)
 *
 * r23 | cocomp | 2007-08-09 06:03:00 +0100 (Thu, 09 Aug 2007) | 8 lines

 * Tag callback functions - improve security (thanks Oliver):
 * 		Added XTemplate::allow_callbacks property (boolean) to allow switching functionality off
 * 		Added XTemplate::allowed_callbacks (array) to limit functions available from templates
 * 		Callbacks now only available for methods of subclasses of XTemplate or as functions in XTemplate::allowed_callbacks array
 *
 * r22 | cocomp | 2007-08-04 00:29:00 +0100 (Sat, 04 Aug 2007) | 13 lines
 * Fix for $_SESSION being empty when using scan_globals method in certain situations
 * Changes to regular expressions: Now use definable delimiter throughout code $preg_delimiter, defaults to ` (backtick)
 * Support top bit set characters x7f-xff in file, block and tags
 * Major new feature: tag callback functions - allow calling of (mutiple) PHP methods (in XTemplate or it's subclasses) or
 *		functions from within a tag prior to output using | (pipe) as delimiter. See ex9.php
 *		contents of tag are sent as a parameter to the callback function or method. NB. Methods take priority over same named function
 *		e.g. {tagname|callback_function} for simple single parameter callback, tag contents passed as only parameter to callback.
 *		e.g. {tagname|callback_function('param1', 'param2', %s)} to allow mutiple parameters to be specified, %s replaced by tag contents.
 *		Real world chaining callbacks together:
 *			e.g. {tagname|str_replace('Hello World', 'Welcome to the Jungle', %s)|strtolower|ucwords|my_user_callback_func}
 *		(Inspired by sf feature request #1756946 christophe_lu)
 * Altered debug code in text method to cater for situations when $tpldir may be an array
 *
 * r21 | cocomp | 2007-05-29 19:00:00 +0000 (Tue, 29 May 2007) | 1 line
 * Added facility for constructor $tpldir to be an array of file paths, the first path supplied that has the file is matched

 * Initial commit CachingXTemplate subclass
 *
 * r18 | cocomp | 2007-01-11 03:29:11 +0000 (Thu, 11 Jan 2007) | 2 lines
 * Major update for initial PHP 5 version
 * Deprecated: PHP 4 constructor, SetNullString (use set_null_string) and SetNullBlock (use set_null_block). Added sf Feature request #1529478. Fixed SF Bug #1261828. Introduced comment_preg property. Refactored assign method - may break some old functionality! Constructor now only calls restart method

 * 2006/05/02:
 *
 * - Added $over_write parameter to assign method which defaults to false. The
 *  behaviour is therefore to always overwrite the name/value array
 * - Fixed bug in regexes for older php version (specifically php 4.2.2) that
 *  caused regex to fail
 *
 * r10 | cocomp | 2005-08-17 10:57:58 +0100 (Wed, 17 Aug 2005) | 11 lines

 * - Moved most regular expressions to use | as delimiter
 * - Improved output with regard to block tags and line endings - much better for xml output
